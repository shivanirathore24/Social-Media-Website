## Documentation [All steps for Project]

### 1: Setting up Directory Structure:

1. Create an 'index.js' file under your project directory i.e 'SocialMediaWebsite' folder.
2. For creating 'package.json,' run the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

3. Create folders using the 'mkdir' command in your project directory. For example:
   - To create a 'routes' folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir routes
   ```
   - To create a 'controllers' folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir controllers
   ```
   - To create a 'views' folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir views
   ```
   - To create a 'models' folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir models
   ```
   - To create a 'config' folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir config
   ```

### 2: Setup Express Server

1. Install express server; then node_modules folder will be created; verify either installed or not: check package.json file --> in dependencies you will find 'express' with verson .
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```
2. Write code in 'index.js' file to setup express server.

### 3: Add .gitignore file and npm start

1. Added "node_modules/" inside .gitignore file.
2. Intially, we were using command to run project:
   ```bash
   nodemon index.js
   ```
3. Now added "start": "nodemon index.js" inside script in package.json, now to run project use command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 4: Set up express Router

1. Created 'index.js' file under 'routes folder' and write code.
2. Entry file(index.js), use express router.
3. Do check "npm start" whether router is loaded or not.

### 5: Create a 'home' Controller and router for request '/':

1. Created 'home_controller.js' file under 'controllers folder' and write code.
2. Access and use 'home function of home_controlleer.js' inside routes(index.js).
3. For default route, access from index.js(entry file): app.use("/", require("./routes"));
4. Start project and check in browser "http://localhost:8000/".

### 6: Create a 'user' controller and router for request 'users/profile':

1. Created 'users_controller.js' file under 'controllers folder' and write code.
2. Created 'users.js' file under 'routes folder'.
3. Access and use 'profile function of users_controlleer.js' inside routes(users.js) for /profile request.
4. routes(index.js) --> root of all other routes i.e for further routes, access from here:
   router.use('/routerName', require('./routerFile'))
   - for request '/'(bydefault): index.js(entry point) --> routes(index.js) --> home_controller.js (home function)
   - for reuqest '/users/profile': index.js(entry point) --> routes(index.js) --> routes(users.js) -->users_controller.js (profile function)

### 7: Routes:

1. routes(index.js): Entry point for all request and handles all direct urls i.e (root level routes) For example : /home , /contact, /about etc
2. routes(users.js): handles all user related request. For example: users/profile , users/create, users/edit etc..

### 8: Install EJS And Setup View Engine:

1. Install EJS; verify either installed or not: check package.json file --> in dependencies you will find 'ejs' with verson.
   ```bash
   npm install ejs
   ```
2. Setup View Engine (EJS) in index.js(entry file).

### 9: Create a View for 'home'

1. Create 'home.ejs' file under 'views folder' to write html code.
2. Edit home_controller.js file, replace 'res.end' method(used to render static data directly to browser) with 'res.render' method(used to render dyanamic content).

### 9: Partial views are not re-used.

1. Partials are particularly useful for reusing the same markup between different views, layouts, and even other partials.
2. Header and Footer which are to be used in both home and user_profile but right now it's not re-used.

### 10: Implementing Partials

1. Created '\_header.ejs' and '\_footer.ejs' partial views files which are to be re-used in different views i.e home and user_profie.
2. Include a relative partial file in a template using <%- include(PARTIAL_FILE) %>.

### 11: Create a layout

1. Install Express EJS Layouts
   ```bash
   npm install express-ejs-layouts
   ```
2. EJS layouts Benefits - simplify code management, enhance efficiency, and ensure a consistent user experience by reusing common elements. This reduces redundancy, speeds up page loading, and eases updates.
3. Use 'express ejs Layout' before express router in index.js(entry file).
4. Create layout.ejs file which gets render, and body i.e '<%- body %>' gets filled with variable part.
5. Keep only variable part in home.ejs and user_profile.ejs.

### 12: Setting up Static files Access

1. Create 'assets' folder under project directory i.e 'SocialMediaWebsite' folder.

   - To create a 'assets' folder:

   ```bash
   mkdir assets
   ```

2. Create sub-folder 'css', 'js' , 'images' within 'assets folder'. Within css folder, create 'layout.css' file and put styling.
3. Setup static assets inside index.js(entry file) using - app.use(express.static("./assets"));
4. Link layout.css "href - /css/layout.css" inside layout.ejs(views folder).
5. Styles will be applied to all other pages (i.e, layout.css contains the common styles) that will be applied to all page which inherit from layout.ejs file.

### 13: Static Files for styling individuals Pages

1. Create user_profile.css file for styling user_profile page and write styles.
2. Link user_profile.css "href - /css/user_profile.css" inside user_profile.ejs(views folder).
3. Run Project, inspect - You will find css link is coming under body which is a bad solution. For better solution follow below steps:
4. Step-1: Extract style and scripts from sub pages into the layout [inside index.js(entry file)]
   - app.set("layout extractStyles", true);
   - app.set("layout extractScripts", true);
5. Step-2: put '<%- style %>' at the end of head tag and '<%- script %>' at the end of body tag [inside layout.ejs]

### 14: Linking to mongoDB using mongoose

1. Mongoose is a Node.js(Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, offering schema definition, data validation, and an API for data operations. It streamlines MongoDB usage, maintaining data integrity, and simplifying Node.js app development with MongoDB.
2. Install mongoose; verify either installed or not: check package.json file --> in dependencies you will find 'mongoose' with verson.
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   ```
3. Create mongoose.js file inside config folder; write code that connects Node.js to a MongoDB database and logs either a successful or failed connection.
4. Imports a database connection setup from the "mongoose.js" file into index.js (entry file).
5. Run Project, you will see "MongoDB connect" message for successful connection.

### 15: Setting up User Schema

1. A schema - used with database like MongoDB, defines the structure of data, specifying the type and organization of fields. It enforces data consistency, validation, and integrity, ensuring that data adheres to a predefined structure.
2. Create 'user.js' file under 'models folder' for userSchema and create fields - email, password and name with timestamps(to record when user was created).

### 16: Rendering Pages for SignUp & SignIn

1. Create 2 files under 'views folder' - 'user_sign_up.ejs' and 'user_sign_in.ejs' and write html code.
2. Add actions - 'signUp' and 'signIn' inside users_controller.js file to handle request from routes.
3. Add Mapping "/sign-up" and "/sign-in" inside user.js(routes) URLs to functions in "users_controller.js"
4. For example- Type URL in browser: http://localhost:8000/users/sign-up --> this url is sent as request to routes --> routes maps this request to action 'signUp' --> 'signUp' action renders view page i.e 'user_sign_up.ejs'.

### 17: Creating Forms for SignUp and SignIn

1. Create forms for signUp and signIn in 'user_sign_up.ejs' and 'user_sign_in.ejs'.
2. After Clicking "Sign Up" button --> Action - '/users/create' will be called --> Add action - 'create' in users_controller.js file & will write code later.
3. After Clicking "Sign In" button --> Action - '/users/create-session' will be called --> Add action - 'createSession' in users_controller.js file & will write code later.

### 18: Creating and Altering a Cookie

1. Cookie - small piece of data stored on a user's web browser by a website, commonly used for - user authentication, session management, and tracking user preferences.
2. "cookie-parser" is a middleware in Node.js that simplifies handling cookies, parsing their data, and attaching them to the request object, making it easier to work with cookies in web applications. Install "cookie-parser" :
   ```bash
   npm install cookie-parser
   ```
3. Use cookie in index.js(entry file) as middleware for parsing cookies, enabling data handling and session management.
4. Run Project> npm start; inspect --> application --> cookies : add - name: user_id and value: 24 (at browser side).
5. In home_controller.js --> you can print user_id value from request body(from browser side) i.e console.log(req.cookies);  
   You can edit value of user_id at server side i.e res.cookie("user_id", 25);
6. Refresh home page, check value at console and in cookie.

## _Authentication Steps:_

- Create user (Sign-up)
- Create Session (Sign-In)
- Show Details of signed-in user on profile page.
- Sign out.

### 19: Create User Sign-Up

1. Create action - 'create' inside users_controller.js for creating user during Sign-up.
2. Action 'create' - to handle user sign-up , utilizes modern asynchronous programming using `async/await` for improved readability and control flow.
   Steps followed :

- Imports the user.js from Models [i.e const User = require("../models/user");], in which user Schema is defined through, which we can interact with database.
- _Password Confirmation_ : if they don't match, the user is redirected back to the registration/sign-up page.

- _User Existence check_ : It then proceeds to query the database to check for the existence of a user with the same email.
  - _If No Matching User is Found_ : A new user is created using the data from the registration form(`model.create(data)' --> i.e User.create(req.body)).
    The user is redirected to the sign-in page.
  - _If a User With the Same Email Already Exists_ : The code redirects the user back to the registration page.
- _Error Handling_ : The code includes error handling to catch and log any issues that may occur during the process. If an error is encountered, the server responds with a server error message (status code 500).

3. Defines a POST request route in user.js(views) where the usersController.create function is executed when the "/create" endpoint is accessed.
   i.e router.post("/create", usersController.create);

4. Click Image: [Data saved in database after Sign-up](../assets/images/output/user_signup_db.png)

### 20. Create User Sign-In (Manual Authentication)

1. Created seperate branch for Manual Authentication :
   ```bash
   git checkout -b manual-local-auth
   ```
2. When user clicks on 'Sign In' button then action - '/users/create-session is called'.
3. Create action - 'createSession' inside users_controller.js for creating Session during Sign-In.
4. The 'createSession' function in the user controller handles user sign-in and session creation, employing modern asynchronous programming with async/await. Steps are taken within this action :

- _User Lookup_ : Search for a user in database with the provided email using await User.findOne({ email: req.body.email }).

- _User Found_ :

  - _Password Check_: If a user is found, check if the provided password matches the user's password stored in the database. If not, the user is redirected back to the 'sign-in' page.
  - _Session Creation_: If the user's email and password match, a session is created. This involves setting a user identifier in a cookie (in response i.e res.cookie("user_id", user.id); - "user_id" is set to the user's ID) and then redirecting the user to their 'profile page'.

- _User Not Found_ : If no user with the provided email is found, the code redirects the user back to the sign-in page, indicating that the user doesn't exist.

- Error Handling : The code includes error handling to catch and log any issues that may occur during the process. If an error is encountered, the server responds with a server error message (status code 500).

4. Defines a POST request in routes(users.js) that links to the createSession function in the usersController. When accessed, it initiates user session creation.

5. If user sign-in successfully --> session is created --> verfiy: inspect --> application --> cookies --> check user_id value that will be same as store in database for that user.

### 21. Show details of Signed-in User

1. Edit 'profile' action of users_controller.js - checking if a user is authenticated via cookies, fetching user data by ID, rendering a profile page (passing a title and user data to the template), and handling potential errors.
2. Show details of user in views(user_profile.js) - displays the user's name and email, using data from the "user" object.

## OR

### 20. Installing and Setting up Passport.js 
1. Install passport.js 
   ```bash
   npm install passport 
   npm install passport-local
   ```
2. Create file 'passport-local-strategy.js ' under config folder - configures Passport, a Node.js authentication middleware, to use a LocalStrategy for user authentication. When a user signs in, Passport finds the user by their email, checks if the password matches, and serializes their user ID into a cookie. When a request is made, it deserializes the user based on the stored user ID from the cookie for authentication
