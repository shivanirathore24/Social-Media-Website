### 1: Setting up Directory Structure:

1. Create an 'index.js' file under your project directory i.e 'SocialMediaWebsite' folder.

2. For creating 'package.json,' run the following command in your project directory:
    ```bash
    npm init
    ```

3. Create folders using the 'mkdir' command in your project directory. For example:

   - To create a 'routes' folder:
    ```bash
    mkdir routes
    ```

   - To create a 'controllers' folder:
    ```bash
    mkdir controllers
    ```

   - To create a 'views' folder:
    ```bash
    mkdir views
    ```

   - To create a 'models' folder:
    ```bash
    mkdir models
    ```

   - To create a 'config' folder:
    ```bash
    mkdir config
    ```
